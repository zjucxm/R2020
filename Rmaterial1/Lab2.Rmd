Today's agenda: data visualization with ggplot2. Get help on dataset ChickWeight by `?ChickWeight`. Play with the following R code to figure out what we are doing here.

### First plot
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(ChickWeight, aes(x=Time, y=weight, colour=Diet)) +
    geom_point(alpha=.3) +
    geom_smooth(alpha=.2, size=1) +
    ggtitle("Fitted growth curve per diet")
p1
```
----
### Second plot
```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(subset(ChickWeight, Time==21), aes(x=weight, colour=Diet)) +
    geom_density() +
    ggtitle("Final weight, by diet")
p2
```
----
### Third plot
```{r}
p3 <- ggplot(subset(ChickWeight, Time==21), aes(x=weight, fill=Diet)) +
    geom_histogram(colour="black", binwidth=50) +
    facet_grid(Diet ~ .) +
    ggtitle("Final weight, by diet") +
    theme(legend.position="none")        # No legend (redundant in this graph)
p3
```
